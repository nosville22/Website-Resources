This is where I put all the Netscape format Buttons I've made.

Netscape format means 88x31 pixels in size, tough it's not an exact spec, and I have already seen some be rounded to 90x32.

This folder contains both optimised and unoptimised versions of buttons.
If they are animated Optimised files are those in .gif format with a lower case "o" at the end. 
If they are static images, the unoptimised version is a .png, and there .gifs are always the smaller sized versions.

Not all files come as both optimised and unoptimised tough, and for some aditional differentiators apply:
Lower case "a" at the end of a file which happens to have a counterpart without it denotesit's an animated version of the button
"_border" or just "border" at the end denotes a two-tone shading around the button, done the same way original Netscape buttons did. I try to include that with most of my 88x31 works but not all fit the style.
